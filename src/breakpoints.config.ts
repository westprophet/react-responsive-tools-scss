/**
 * Preferred adaptive layout variant.
 *
 * 'DtF' stands for "Desktop To First" and is used as the default strategy
 * for resolving overlaps between "mobile-first" (`min-width`) and
 * "desktop-first" (`max-width`) breakpoints.
 *
 * When switching between these variants we shift the opposite boundary
 * by 1px to avoid cases when two ranges overlap at the exact same pixel.
 *
 * For example:
 *  - `min-width: 300px` includes 300px,
 *  - `max-width: 300px` also includes 300px,
 * which causes an overlap. By shifting one of them by 1px we guarantee
 * that a given pixel belongs to only one range.
